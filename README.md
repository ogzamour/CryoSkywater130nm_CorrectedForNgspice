# CryoSkywater130nm_CorrectedForNgspice
NGSpice simulation using translated cryogenic PDk models based on https://github.com/UTA-Advanced-Detector-Technologies/Skywater-130nm-77K-Cryogenic-Models/tree/main 

## Downloading_Volare

First, ensure Volare is properly set up (I did this by creating a seperate file titled skywater130nm where I placed all the things downloaded from volare (which should be 3 top files: volare, sky130A, sky130B.) 
My path essentially looked like /home/<user>/skywater130nm/volare...)

To download volare, I used the following (with <desired_PDK_directory> = skywater130nm):

```
#Taken from original cryo repo

pip install volare

export PDK_ROOT="/home/<your_username>/<desired_PDK_directory>"

volare ls-remote --pdk sky130

volare enable --pdk sky130 a918dc7c8e474a99b68c85eb3546b4ed91fe9e7b
```

## Downloading_Ngspice

I used jupyter notebooks for this, so that is the setup I will show. However, just make sure version 41 of ngspice is installed and it should work.
This is the setup I used, and I just made sure sims were run in spice_env:
```
  conda activate spice_env
  conda install -c conda-forge ngspice=41
  which ngspice
  ngspice --version
```

## Enviornment_Setup
In order to correctly set up the 77k nfet file to work with the rest of volare, you will want to place sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8_lvt__tt_77k.corner.spice in the following directory:
```
skywater130nm/volare/sky130/versions/a918dc7c8e474a99b68c85eb3546b4ed91fe9e7b/sky130A/libs.ref/sky130_fd_pr/spice
```
***Use the original, non translated file versions in compressed-cryo-files. Just make sure to change the .lib file as described. The translated file version is not necessary.***

Once the correct nfet file has been placed in the directory, you will want to update the sky130.lib.spice file (/home/<user>/skywater130nm/volare/sky130/versions/a918dc7c8e474a99b68c85eb3546b4ed91fe9e7b/sky130A/libs.tech/ngspice/sky130.lib.spice)
To do this, insert the following code in sky130.lib.spice under '******* SkyWater sky130 model library *********':

```
* Typical corner (tt) at 77K
.lib tt_77k
.param mc_mm_switch=0
.param mc_pr_switch=0
.param my_gauss = 0
.param m = 1
.include "/home/<user>/skywater130nm/volare/sky130/versions/a918dc7c8e474a99b68c85eb3546b4ed91fe9e7b/sky130A/libs.ref/sky130_fd_pr/spice/sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8_lvt__tt_77k.corner.spice"
*.include "/home/<user>/skywater130nm/volare/sky130/versions/a918dc7c8e474a99b68c85eb3546b4ed91fe9e7b/sky130A/libs.ref/sky130_fd_pr/spice/pfet_01v8_lvt/77k_models/sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8_lvt__tt_77k.corner.spice"

.include "/home/<user>/skywater130nm/volare/sky130/versions/a918dc7c8e474a99b68c85eb3546b4ed91fe9e7b/sky130A/libs.ref/sky130_fd_pr/spice/sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8_lvt__mismatch.corner.spice"
*.include "/home/<user>/skywater130nm/volare/sky130/versions/a918dc7c8e474a99b68c85eb3546b4ed91fe9e7b/sky130A/libs.ref/sky130_fd_pr/spice/pfet_01v8_lvt/sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8_lvt__mismatch.corner.spice"

.include "r+c/res_typical__cap_typical.spice"
.include "r+c/res_typical__cap_typical__lin.spice"

* Special cells
.include "corners/tt/specialized_cells.spice"


.endl
```
(To use pfet, delete '*' in front of the include statements)

After this, to use the pdk at 77k, just change the .lib declaration in the ngspice simulation files from tt to tt_77k!

## Running_NGSpice_Sims

The ngspice simulation can be run just from the terminal. Inside the simulation folder in the repo, you will find 4 .spice files: 
- vds_sweep_IV.spice : Sweeps VDS with constant VGS
- vgs_sweep_IV.spice : Sweeps VGS with constant VDS
- vgs_sweep_varVDS.spice : Sweeps VGS several times over a set of constant VDS
- vds_sweep_varVGS.spice : Sweeps VDS several times over a set of constant VGS

These can be run by typing ```ngspice -b <desiredSimFile>.spice``` in the terminal while in the simulation directory. 

To plot the results, use plotting-spice.ipynb, where there are several different plotting methods depending on which simulation was run.
(note: if you set ngspice in a specific enviornment like spice_env, make sure it is active while trying to run the simulation)


## RRMS

To get the RRMS calculation for the scripts, first ensure you have the cryo_data file from the paper repo downloaded. Also ensure both the nfet and pfet 77k corners are installed properly and defined in the .lib file.
Then, run ```python runAll.py``` in both the nfet_mod and pfet_mod directories ***Note: will have to change path in the .include***

After both are run, ensure the paths in getRMS.py match your directory (for both the cryo data and modeled pfet/nfet data). Then, run ```python getRMS.py``` in the ngspice-skywater-sims directory and the RRMS should print in terminal.

***could also choose to not rerun pfet/nfet models since the output files are included already in repo***
